Notes:
- To handle HTTP POST request in Express.js version 4 and above, you need to install middleware module called body-parser.
- body-parser extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on request.body.
- The middleware was a part of Express.js earlier but now you have to install it separately.
- This body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request. Install body-parser using NPM as shown below.
